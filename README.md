## Project Name: TBD (DéjàBu, Brewposium)

### 1. Overview

* Users are able to review Brewpubs and individual brews at the pubs. The value this app provides is to lead users to new/different Brewpubs that offer beers that meet their particular preferences. For example, if a user wants to visit a brewpub with a double IPA, then this app will be able to list pubs with double IPAs and show and provide ratings and reviews.)

* What does this project do: 
	* Allows consumers to look for pubs that offer different brews in the area based on rating. Consumers can also rate the pubs and their experience, while also being able to comment on them.

* Who is it for:
	* Consumers who are interested in finding local pubs to go to, or find one that is in a different area for a different experience.

* Why do you need it:
	* It is a tool that is designed specifically for finding and rating brewpubs, so whoever uses it will be able to determine if they want to visit a pub based on previous user’s experiences.
